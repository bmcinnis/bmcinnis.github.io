					<h2>About</h2>					
					<p>
						<span class="highlight">The purpose of my research is to help people collaboratively build insights around civic concerns, policy issues, and ethical questions</span>.  I conduct my system design and public policy research as a cycle that begins with investigations into the opportunities and barriers to informed discussion on collaboration platforms (e.g., Slack) and at news websites (e.g., New York Times).  I then use this research about existing systems to develop and evaluate new ways to promote informed discussion through controlled experiments and field studies.  As a theoretical lens to inform my research, I apply modern concepts from crowdsourcing to advance century-old practices in public deliberation, because I see great promise in the capability of computing systems to coordinate groups of people to problem-solve a civic issue through informed discussion.

							<h5 class="card-title">Factors Influencing Informed Consent Preferences in Digital Health Research: Survey Study of Prospective Participants</h5>
							<h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Brian McInnis, Ramona Pindus, Daniah Kareem, Daniela Vital, Eric Hekler, Camille Nebeker</h6>
							<p class="card-text">Readability is important to consider when developing informed consent communications for prospective research participants, but not the most important consideration. Other factors to consider relate to learning preferences and literacy needs of people recruited to participate in research, as these factors can influence understanding of consent communications. To promote understanding among prospective participants, researchers should take a human-centered approach to develop consent communications. This study aims to explore how factors related to readability, topic, and participant demographic characteristics play into preferences for digital health research consent material. These factors are important to consider as not attending to some details that matter to a specific subgroup of prospective participants may systematically exclude people from research. The findings point toward new ways of evaluating informed consent communication: (1) for responsiveness to specific prospective participant populations, and (2) effectiveness at eliciting informed questions from people considering participation. We discuss how creating partnerships with prospective participants to prototype informed consent materials, specifically study procedures and risks, can be a way to identify those details before launching a study. Furthermore, future research should go beyond “readability” to explore alternate measures of evaluating consent materials, such as the likelihood that the consent material and communication procedures will elicit “informed questions” for the research team.</p>

							<h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Brian McInnis, Ramona Pindus, Daniah Kareem, Julie Cakici, Daniela Vital, Eric Hekler, Camille Nebeker</h6>
							<p class="card-text">Digital health research involves collecting vast amounts of personal health data, making data management practices complex and challenging to convey during informed consent. We conducted eight semi-structured focus groups to explore whether dataflow diagrams (DFD) can complement informed consent and improve participants' understanding of data management and associated risks (N = 34 participants). Our analysis found that DFDs could supplement text-based information about data management and sharing practices, such as by helping raise new questions that prompt conversation between prospective participants and members of a research team. Prospective research participants value diverse ways of learning about study risks and benefits. Our study highlights the value of incorporating information visualizations, such as DFDs, into the informed consent procedures to participate in research.</p>

							<h5 class="card-title">Considerations for the Design of Informed Consent in Digital Health Research: Participant Perspectives</h5>
							<h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Brian McInnis, Ramona Pindus, Daniah Kareem, Camille Nebeker</h6>
							<p class="card-text">The research team, prospective participants, and written materials all influence the success of the informed consent process. As digital health research becomes more prevalent, new challenges for successful informed consent are introduced. This exploratory research utilized a human centered design process in which 19 people were enrolled to participate in one of four online focus-groups. Participants discussed their experiences with informed consent, preferences for receiving study information and ideas about alternative consent approaches. Data were analyzed using qualitative methods. Six major themes and sixteen sub-themes were identified that included study information that prospective participants would like to receive, preferences for accessing information and a desire to connect with research team members. Specific to digital health, participants expressed a need to understand how the technologies worked and how the volume of granular personal information would be collected, stored, and shared.</p>

							<h5 class="card-title">Exploring the Future of Informed Consent: Applying a Service Design Approach</h5>
							<h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Brian McInnis, Ramona Pindus, Daniah Kareem, Savannah Gamboa, Camille Nebeker</h6>
							<p class="card-text">Informed consent is a cornerstone of ethical human subject research. This practice demonstrates the ethical principle of "respect for persons." Our study was designed to imagine an informed consent future, specifically in a digital health context in which informed consent processes are mediated by sociotechnical systems. Design speed-dating workshops were conducted to explore dimensions of the consent communication design space, including social media, interactive quizzes, chat-bots, annotation tools, and virtual learning sessions. To explore both the user experience and how futuristic consent processes might be facilitated, the workshops involved people eligible to participate in digital health research (N=21) and service providers (N=20), including researchers and IRB members. Our findings offer five principles to improve digital informed consent processes: be concise, promote transparency, value time and effort, cultivate trust, and navigate platform risks.</p>

							<h5 class="card-title">Engagement or Knowledge Retention: Exploring Trade-offs in Promoting Discussion at News Websites</h5>
							<h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Brian McInnis, Leah Ajmani, Steven Dow</h6>
							<p class="card-text">How does presenting comments in a news article affect the ways that readers engage with and retain information about news? This paper presents results from a controlled experiment investigating effects related to different strategies for promoting discussion at news websites (N=336 participants). The strategies include highlighting specific comments about a data visualization, providing prompts with the comments, and annotating prompts on the visualization. By comparison to a simple list of comments (baseline), our analysis found that annotations contributed to higher levels of participant engagement in the discussion, yet lower levels of knowledge retention related to the article. These findings raise new considerations about whether and how to integrate discussion content into news and points toward future content moderation systems that assist in representing and eliciting discussion at news websites.</p>

							<h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Brian McInnis, Leah Ajmani, Lu Sun, Yiwen Hou, Ziwen Zeng, Steven Dow</h6>
							<p class="card-text">Due to challenges around low-quality comments and misinformation, many news outlets have opted to turn off commenting features on their websites. The New York Times (NYT), on the other hand, has continued to scale up its online discussion resources to reach large audiences. Through interviews with the NYT moderation team, we present examples of how moderators manage the first ∼24 hours of online discussion after a story breaks, while balancing concerns about journalistic credibility. We discuss how managing comments at the NYT is not merely a matter of content regulation, but can involve reporting from the “community beat” to recognize emerging topics and synthesize the multiple perspectives in a discussion to promote community.</p>

							<h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Molly Q Feldman and Brian McInnis</h6>
							<p class="card-text">Writing is a common task for crowdsourcing researchers exploring complex and creative work. To better understand how we write with crowds, we conducted both a literature review of crowd-writing systems and structured interviews with designers of such systems.  We argue that the cognitive process theory of writing described by Flower and Hayes (1981), originally proposed as a theory of how solo writers write, offers a useful analytic lens for examining the design of crowd-writing systems.</p>

							<p class="card-text">Organizations often strive to build a shared understanding about complex problems. Design competitions provide a compelling approach to create incentives and infrastructure for gathering insights about a problem-space. In this paper, we present an analysis of a two-month civic design competition focused on transportation challenges in a major US city. We examine how the event structure, discussion platform, and participant interactions affected how a community collectively discussed design constraints and proposals.</p>

							<h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Brian McInnis, Gilly Leshed, Dan Cosley</h6>
							<p class="card-text">Inspired by policy deliberation methods and iterative writing in crowdsourcing, we developed and evaluated a task in which newcomers to an online policy discussion, before entering the discussion, generate prompts that encourage existing commenters to engage with each other. In an experiment with 453 Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) crowd workers, we found that newcomers can often craft acceptable prompts, especially when given guidance on prompt-writing and balanced opinions between the comments they synthesize.</p>

							<p class="card-text">Public concern related to a policy may span a range of topics. As a result, policy discussions struggle to deeply examine any one topic before moving to the next. In policy deliberation research, this is referred to as a problem of topical coherence. In an experiment, we curated the comments in a policy discussion to prioritize arguments for or against a policy proposal, and examined how this curation and participants’ initial positions of support or opposition to the policy affected the coherence of their contributions to existing topics.</p>

							<h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Brian McInnis, Dan Cosley, Chaebong Nam, Gilly Leshed</h6>
							<p class="card-text">Online crowd labor markets often address issues of risk and mistrust between employers and employees from the employers’ perspective, but less often from that of employees. Based on 437 comments posted by crowd workers (Turkers) on the Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) participation agreement, we identified work rejection as a major risk that Turkers experience. We argue that making reducing risk and building trust a first-class design goal can lead to solutions that improve outcomes around rejected work for all parties in online labor markets.</p>

							<h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Brian McInnis, Elizabeth Murnane, Dmitry Epstein, Dan Cosley, Gilly Leshed</h6>
							<p class="card-text">Often, attention to "community" focuses on motivating core members or helping newcomers become regulars.
